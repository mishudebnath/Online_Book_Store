tags. Home page is divided into 3 frames by using <frameset> and <frame> tags. A frame is 
used to display a web page within a web page. 

<frameset>: 
 The <frameset> tag defines a frameset. 
 The <frameset> element holds one or more <frame> elements. 
 Each <frame> element can hold a separate document. 
 The <frameset> element specifies HOW MANY columns or rows there will be in the 
frameset, and HOW MUCH percentage/pixels of space will occupy each of them. 

<frame>: 
 The <frame> tag defines one particular window (frame) within a <frameset>. 
 Each <frame> in a <frameset> can have different attributes, such as border, scrolling, 
the ability to resize, etc.
